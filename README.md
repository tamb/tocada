# Tocada JS
Touch Events with ease
<br/>

It's dead simple to use

```
/**
Add events for
swipe // fired before swipeleft, up, down, right events
swipeup
swiperight
swipedown
swipeleft
gesture // fired before any pinch or spread
pinch
spread
*/
const swipeArea = new Tocada (querySelector | element);

/**
Remove events
*/
swipeArea.destroy();

```
